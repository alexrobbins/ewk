h1. Introduction

ewk is a probabilistic webpage classification library that uses enlive selectors and clojure functions as feature definitions. An example of a feature definiton is:

<pre>
{:name “is_home”            :at “p#currentpage” :extract (fn [xs] (= (first xs) “home”))}
{:name “currentpage_length” :at “p#currentpage” :extract (fn [xs] (count (first xs)))}
</pre>

The 'extract' function is passed a list of matching html contents (as per enlive).
The 'is_home' feature would be on if the page contains '&lt;p id='currentpage'&gt;home&lt;/p&gt;'.
The 'currentpage_length' feature extracts the length of the 'currentpage' div.

Classification is done using clj-ml (a wrapper around the Weka
library) and currently supports only logistic regression. This library
makes it simple to specify feature sets and training data, and simple to run classification on html.
